## Key Encapsulation Mecanism (KEM) for Post-Quantum Cryptography

<p align='justify'>FrodoKEM is a post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism, which means that it is designed to exchange keys securely between two parties. It is based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem, would be included for standardization by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and recommended for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration by the BSI (German Federal Office for Information Security) and the ANSSI (French Cybersecurity Agency). It is closely related to the challenging time-computational problem inherent to algebraically unstructured lattices</p>
